Recognition of objects and patterns,three major approach:
1.brute force,
search the parametric space of all possible image degradations
extreme time complexity,practically inapplicable

2.image normalization,
the objects are transformed into a certain standard position before they enter the classifier
efficient in the classification stage but the object normalization
itself usually requires solving difficult inverse problems that are often illconditioned or even ill-posed

3.invariant feature
invariant I, degradation operator D, satisfies the condition I(f) = I(D(f)), for any image function f.
This property is called invariance
Another desirable property of I, as important as invariance, is discriminability. 
For objects belonging to different classes, I must have significantly different values. 


• Simple shape descriptors – compactness, convexity, elongation, etc.
• Transform coefficient features are calculated from a certain transform of the image – 
Fourier descriptors , Hadamard descriptors, Radon transform coefficients, and wavelet-based features ,
• Point set invariants use positions of dominant points 
• Differential invariants employ derivatives of the object boundary
• Moment invariants are special functions of image moments.
